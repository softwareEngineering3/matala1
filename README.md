# matala1

in this project we will use an open-source to solve the problam of finding the shortest path betwen two points.

the problem:

some of the points will be defined as "black-listed" and the path must not go through them.

also we need to find a radius and diameter of graph

In this project we use the Dijkstra  Algorithm.

input: 2 text file. first is data of graph-vertexes, edges and weight of them. second is list of path than we need to find and black vertexes on there paths.

output: paths between vertexes,diameter,radius of graph and running time of all program 

The open-source we used:

moodle of course "algorithm 2"
